## Taking Processing further with physical computing

Processing is so awesome that there are too many features to mention in just one tutorial! If you feel like you've got to grips with the [first page](worksheet.md), and you would like learn how to use [Processing for physical computing](https://www.processing.org/reference/libraries/io/index.html), then follow the steps below.

This worksheet will show the basics of input and output with Processing. To get a deeper understanding of what you can do with physical computing, check out the [physical computing guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/physical-computing-guide).
