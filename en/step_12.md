## What next?

- Learn more about how to use the functions in the [Processing Hardware I/O library here](https://www.processing.org/reference/libraries/io/index.html) and review some of the [technical notes about it here](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Raspberry-Pi).
- Try using code to create a piece of animated artwork.
- Do you have any other electronic components to wire up and use with Processing?
- Why not take a look at the [Exhibition section](https://processing.org/exhibition/) of Processing.org and get inspired for your next project?
- Adapt another [physical computing project](https://www.raspberrypi.org/resources/make/) to use Processing instead of Scratch or Python.
