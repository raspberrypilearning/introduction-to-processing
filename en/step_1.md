## What you will make
[Processing](https://processing.org/) is an open-source development environment and programming language, designed for learning how to code. While it's very flexible and powerful, it's mainly used in the realm of visual arts. Processing was created by Ben Fry and Casey Reas in 2001. With the help of Dan Shiffman, they continue to lead [a team of volunteer developers](https://processing.org/people/) to enhance and maintain the project. As a participant in Google's Summer of Code, Gottfried Haider worked on Raspberry Pi support and the GPIO libraries.

## What you will learn
By following this Processing tutorial on your Raspberry Pi you will learn:
- How to download and install Processing
- How to draw basic graphics using functions
- How to react to mouse input
- How to control GPIO outputs, like LEDs
- How to listen to GPIO inputs, like physical buttons and switches

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)
- [Use basic digital, analogue, and electromechanical components](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/creator)
